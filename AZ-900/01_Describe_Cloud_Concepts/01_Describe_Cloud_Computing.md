# What is Cloud Computing ?
- Cloud Computing is delivery of computing services over internet. Computing services like common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.
- Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).
- It helps to scale up your IT infrastructure rapidly.

# Shared Responsibility model
- For traditional corporate data center, the company is comepleletly responsible for maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and maintaining or replacing the servers if anything happens.
- With shared responsibility model, the responsibilities of maintaining a data center get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer.
- Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider.
- At the same time the consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud. He is also responsible for access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it.
- With an on-premises datacenter, consumer responsible for everything. With cloud computing, those responsibilities shift. The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types (covered later in this learning path): infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity.

# Cloud Models
The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.

## Private Cloud
- It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity.
- It provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment.
- It can be hosted from your on site datacenter, it can be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite,potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.
  
## Public Cloud
- A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider.
- With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources.
  
## Hybrid Cloud
- A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment.
- A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources.
- Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

| Public Cloud | Private Cloud | Hybrid Cloud |
| -------------| --------------|--------------|
| No capital expenditures to scale up	| Organizations have complete control over resources and security	| Provides the most flexibility |
| Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned	| Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data | Organizations determine where to run their applications |
| Organizations pay only for what they use | Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance	| Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements |
| Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security	| Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates	| |

# Consumption based model
When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider.
- Capital expenditure (CapEx)
  CapEx is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. <br/>
  A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.
  
- operational expenditure (OpEx)
   OpEx is spending money on services or products over time. <br/>
   Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

- Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. With cloud computing, you don’t pay for the physical infrastructure,
  the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use. If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.

- This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

    - No upfront costs.
    - No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
    - The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
    - The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
